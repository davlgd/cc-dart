# Clever Cloud Dart example

This is a Dart example for the Clever Cloud platform. It's a simple "Hello, world!" web server. First, you need [`clever-tools`](https://github.com/CleverCloud/clever-tools) installed and your account connected:

```bash
npm install -g clever-tools
clever login
```

Then, clone this repository and deploy the app with the following commands:

```bash
clever create -t node myDartApp
clever scale --flavor pico
clever scale --build-flavor M
clever env import < .env
clever deploy && clever open
```

If you need to deplot a [Dart Frog](https://dartfrog.vgv.dev/) app, you can follow [this script](https://carbon.now.sh/?bg=rgba%28171%2C+184%2C+195%2C+1%29&t=cobalt&wt=none&l=application%2Fx-sh&width=680&ds=true&dsyoff=20px&dsblur=68px&wc=true&wa=true&pv=56px&ph=56px&ln=false&fl=1&fm=Hack&fs=14px&lh=133%25&si=false&es=2x&wm=false&code=%2523%2520Follow%2520these%2520instructions%2520to%2520deploy%2520a%2520Dart%2520Frog%2520app%2520on%2520Clever%2520Cloud%250A%2523%2520You%2520need%2520git%2520and%2520Dart%2520already%2520setup%2520on%2520your%2520local%2520machine%250A%2523%2520-%2520https%253A%252F%252Fgit-scm.com%252Fbook%252Fen%252Fv2%252FGetting-Started-Installing-Git%250A%2523%2520-%2520https%253A%252F%252Fdart.dev%252Fget-dart%250A%250A%2523%2520To%2520deploy%2520on%2520Clever%2520Cloud%252C%2520you%2520also%2520need%2520clever-tools%252C%2520logged%2520in%250A%2523%2520You%2520can%2520use%2520npm%2520to%2520install%2520it%250Anpm%2520i%2520-g%2520clever-tools%250Aclever%2520login%250A%250A%2523%2520First%252C%2520disable%2520analytics%252C%2520install%2520Dart%2520Frog%2520CLI%2520and%2520create%2520an%2520app%250Adart%2520--disable-analytics%250Adart%2520pub%2520global%2520activate%2520dart_frog_cli%250Adart_frog%2520create%2520my_dart_frog_app%250A%250A%2523%2520Create%2520a%2520Clever%2520Cloud%2520Node.js%2520app%252C%2520configure%2520it%250Acd%2520my_dart_frog_app%250Agit%2520init%250Aclever%2520create%2520-t%2520node%2520my_dart_frog_app%250Aclever%2520scale%2520--flavor%2520pico%250Aclever%2520scale%2520--build-flavor%2520M%250Aclever%2520env%2520set%2520CC_PRE_BUILD_HOOK%2520%2522bash%2520get.sh%2522%250Aclever%2520env%2520set%2520CC_POST_BUILD_HOOK%2520%2522bash%2520build.sh%2522%250Aclever%2520env%2520set%2520CC_OVERRIDE_BUILDCACHE%2520%2522package.json%253A%252Fbuild%252Fbin%252Fserver%2522%250A%250A%2523%2520Create%2520get%2520script%252C%2520change%2520DART_VERSION%2520if%2520needed%250Acat%2520%253C%253C%27EOF%27%2520%253Eget.sh%250ADART_VERSION%253D3.2.6%250ADEST_BIN%253D%2522%2524%257BHOME%257D%252F.local%252Fbin%2522%250AFILENAME%253Ddartsdk-linux-x64-release.zip%250ADART_URL%253Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fstorage.googleapis.com%252Fdart-archive%252Fchannels%252Fstable%252Frelease%252F%2524%257BDART_VERSION%257D%252Fsdk%252F%2524%257BFILENAME%257D%250A%250Acurl%2520--create-dirs%2520-s%2520-L%2520-o%2520%2524%257BDEST_BIN%257D%252F%2524%257BFILENAME%257D%2520%2524%257BDART_URL%257D%250Acd%2520%2524%257BDEST_BIN%257D%250Aunzip%2520-q%2520%2524%257BFILENAME%257D%2520-d%2520%2524%257BDEST_BIN%257D%250Arm%2520-f%2520%2524%257BFILENAME%257D%250AEOF%250A%250A%2523%2520Create%2520build%2520script%250A%2523%2520We%2520compile%2520the%2520app%2520in%2520the%2520build%2520instance%250A%2523%2520It%2520allow%2520to%2520use%2520the%2520binary%2520without%2520Dart%2520from%2520the%2520run%2520instance%250A%2523%2520It%27s%2520the%2520only%2520file%2520we%2520keep%2520in%2520the%2520build%2520cache%2520with%2520package.json%2520to%2520reduce%2520footprint%250Acat%2520%253C%253C%27EOF%27%2520%253Ebuild.sh%250Aexport%2520PATH%253D%2522%2524PATH%253A%252Fhome%252Fbas%252F.local%252Fbin%252Fdart-sdk%252Fbin%252F%253A%252Fhome%252Fbas%252F.pub-cache%252Fbin%252F%2522%250A%250Adart%2520%2520pub%2520global%2520activate%2520dart_frog_cli%250Adart_frog%2520build%250Adart%2520compile%2520exe%2520build%252Fbin%252Fserver.dart%2520-o%2520build%252Fbin%252Fserver%250AEOF%250A%250A%2523%2520Create%2520package.json%2520to%2520launch%2520the%2520built%2520binary%250Acat%2520%253C%253C%27EOF%27%2520%253Epackage.json%250A%257B%250A%2520%2520%2522name%2522%253A%2520%2522myDartFrogApp%2522%252C%250A%2520%2520%2522scripts%2522%253A%2520%257B%250A%2520%2520%2520%2520%2522start%2522%253A%2520%2522.%252Fbuild%252Fbin%252Fserver%2522%250A%2520%2520%257D%250A%257D%250AEOF%250A%250A%2523%2520git%2520push%21%2520and%2520get%2520the%2520app%2520domain%250A%2523%2520By%2520default%252C%2520it%27s%2520app_id.cleverapps.io%250A%2523%2520To%2520test%2520the%2520app%252C%2520use%253A%2520curl%2520app_id.cleverapps.io%250Agit%2520add%2520.%2520%2526%2526%2520git%2520commit%2520-m%2520%2522Init%2522%250Aclever%2520deploy%250Aclever%2520domain).
